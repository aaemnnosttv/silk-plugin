A modern API for WordPress.

**This project is still in early development and may introduce breaking changes.**

## What is Silk?

Silk is a library designed as a thin layer on top of WordPress, abstracting away the mess of functions into a clean and expressive object-oriented API.  Use as much or little as you want, while maintaining compatibility with everything else that's meant to work with WordPress.

[See the Wiki](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/silk/wiki) for examples and documentation.

## Installation
