A modern API for WordPress.

== Description ==

Silk is a library designed as a thin layer on top of WordPress, abstracting away the mess of functions into a clean and expressive object-oriented API.  Use as much or little as you want, while maintaining compatibility with everything else that's meant to work with WordPress.

[See the Wiki](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/silk/wiki) for examples and documentation.

**Silk requires PHP version 5.5 or higher.**

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/silk` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
